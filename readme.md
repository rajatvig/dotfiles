# A work in progress

My primary work machine died an inglorious death.

I got a loaner vanilla machine.

I missed the software and configuration.

So I started to keep a track of things I do so it could be repeated.

# Caveats

1. May not be useful to everybody and not completely tested.
2. Only OS 10.10 *Yosemite* supported
