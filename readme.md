# What

A collection of scripts, configuration to automate
my install of OS X.

# Included Batteries

1. [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)
2. [fish](http://fishshell.com/) and Oh-My-Fish(https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)
3. [direnv](http://direnv.net/)
4. Configurations for Homebrew, Pyenv, node
5. Other Editors - Atom, Vim

# Why

My primary work machine died an inglorious death.
I got a loaner vanilla machine, on course to get another in a month.
I missed the software and configuration.
Didn't want to repeat installation and configuration ad nauseum.
So I started to keep a track of things, keeping it as automated as possible.

# Caveats

1. As is may not be useful to everyone.
2. Some stuff is not idempotent.
2. Scripts tested on OS X only.
